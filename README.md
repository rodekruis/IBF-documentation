# IBF documentation

IBF public documentation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is the public documentation related to [IBF v2](https://github.com/rodekruis/IBF-system), which is not in MVP-state yet and does not have much documentation yet. Find the documentation of the old IBF-system repo [here](https://github.com/rodekruis/IBF-system/wiki).
